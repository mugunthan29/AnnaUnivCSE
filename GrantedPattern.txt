Description:Field of the Invention

[0001]	The present invention relates to a system for monitoring online examinations. More particularly, the present invention relates to a system and method for proctoring examination. 

Background of the Invention

[0002]	Online examination systems have gained widespread adoption in recent years due to their convenience and scalability. However, ensuring the integrity and security of online examinations remains a significant challenge. Conventional proctoring systems often fail to adequately monitor candidates, detect violations, or verify the authenticity of examination attempts. They lack essential components such as integrated devices for taking exams, real-time monitoring through web camera and microphones, or effective storage systems for examination data. These shortcomings create gaps in monitoring and allow potential opportunities for malpractice to go undetected.

[0003]	The existing systems do not provide mechanisms to capture real-time data, including visuals and audio of candidates, nor do they record snapshots of a candidate's screen when answers are submitted. Such systems are unable to verify actions or detect anomalies during examinations. Additionally, the absence of a proper database architecture limits the ability to securely and effectively conduct the examination, such systems fail to ensure data integrity and consistency.

[0004]	The existing systems do not prevent unauthorized access as they are less secure and do not encrypt the data. Moreover, some systems neglect to verify the presence or functionality of essential devices, such as web cameras, virtual cameras, and microphones, before allowing candidates to proceed with the examination. This lacks pre-examination checks which undermines the credibility of the proctoring process.

[0005]	Another critical deficiency is the inability of many systems to detect violations, such as missing faces, multiple faces, or blank images, during examination sessions. Without embedding metadata for these violations into captured evidence, such systems are ill-equipped to flag or address misconduct. Furthermore, conventional systems cannot often generate comprehensive collage or video files that consolidate images of the student, screenshots, timestamps, and metadata for efficient post-examination scrutiny.

[0006]	Finally, the absence of access control mechanisms and search functionalities in many proctoring systems hinders administrators from retrieving and analysing evidence securely and efficiently. Without the ability to search by candidate identification number or exam location, the examination review process becomes cumbersome and error-prone, making these systems unsuitable for large-scale or high-stakes environment

[0007]	Therefore, there is a need for a system and a method for examination proctoring that overcomes some or all the problems of the existing prior art. 

Objects of the Invention

The examination module (102) displays each question sequentially and the student accesses the questions through the student interface module (102a) to answer sequentially. Once the student selects/submits the answer through the first electronic device (110), the examination module (102) captures the screenshot of each answer individually through the virtual camera (114). Further, the examination module (102) captures the images of the student through the web camera (116) in every 5 seconds Also, the examination module (102) records the audio of the student continuously during the examination. In the present embodiment, the time for capturing the student visual/images through the web camera (116) is 5 seconds per image. In another embodiment, the time for capturing the visual and images may be of 4 seconds per image. It is obvious for the person skilled in the art to set any time or no time for capturing the visuals /images of the student between each image captured by the web camera (116). 

[0038]	The second electronic device (120) is configured with the administrator interface module (102b). The administrator interface module (102b) is connected to the student interface module (102a) through the examination module (102) which enables the administrator to monitor the student during the examination. In the present embodiment, the second electronic device (120) is the computer. In an embodiment, the administrator may use a laptop as the second electronic device (120). It is obvious for the person skilled in the to use any electronic device (120) for proctoring examination. 


[0039]	For example, when the student starts the examination by providing student credentials and activates the web camera (116), and microphone (112). The examination module (102) shows each question at a time on the screen of the first electronic device (110). The student selects the answer, and as soon as the student selects the answer the examination module (102) captures the snapshot/screenshot through the virtual camera (114). The system (100) captures the images of the student through the web camera (116) every 5 seconds and records the audio of the student continuously during the examination. After  administrator can access the administrator interface module (102b) through the second electronic device (120) and analyse the activities of each student at to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, attempts of hacking, tampering.. In the present embodiment, the system (100) allows the administrator to analyse each student data through the second electric device (120). 

[0040]	In an embodiment, the examination module (102) may display the real-time movement of multiple students on the second electronic device (120) to allow the administrator to monitor multiple students at the same time. It is obvious for the persons skilled in the art to configure the administrator interface module (102b) with features to monitor the multiple students during the examination.

[0041]	Referring again to figure 1, a server (130) having an interface module (136).  The interface module (136) is connected to the student interface module (102a) and the administrator interface module (102b). The server (130) includes a primary database (132), a file storage (not shown) and a secondary database (134) to store data from the first electronic device (110). The primary database (132) stores the exam attempt data (answers) given by the student through the first electronic device (110). The images of the student captured by the web camera (116), audio recordings from the microphone (112), and the screenshot embedded with the metadata of the first electronic device (110) are stored in the file storage (not shown).  The secondary database (134) stores the extracted metadata, including the question ID and attempted option ID, from the screenshots stored in the file storage (not shown).  Once the student starts the examination process, the examination module (102) collects the data from the first electronic device (110), including selected/submitted answer of the student and stores in the primary database (132). Also, the first electronic device (110) captures the screenshot of the submitted answer, the images of the student embedded with the metadata, and the recorded audio of the student stores in the file storage. The server (130) stores the data from the first electronic device (110) in a separate database to prevent discrepancies and inconsistencies during the examination.

[0042]	Further, the examination module (102) encrypts the examination data from the first electronic device (110) to ensure secure storage within the primary database (132) and secondary database (134). The enables the administrator to access the examination data within the primary database (132) and secondary database (134) of the server (130) through the administrator interface module (102b) after the examination. 

[0043]	The examination module (102) enables the student to proceed with the examination only after verifying the presence and functionality of the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and microphone (112) within the first electronic device (110). In case any feature from the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), or microphone (112) does not work, the examination module (102) will not allow the student to go ahead with the examination, to examine without any loophole for cheating for the student.

[0044]	Furthermore, the examination module (102) analyses the examination data received from the web camera (116) and identifies violations such as undetected faces, multiple faces, or blank images, and like during the exam. The violations are recorded in the file storage for post-exam analysis.

[0045]	The examination module (102) evaluates the examination data received from the primary database (132) and the secondary database (134) to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or attempts of hacking or tampering. Specifically, the examination module (102) compares the examination data stored in the primary database (132) and secondary database (134). The examination module (102) compares each submitted answer stored in the primary database (132) by the student with extracted metadata of the screenshots and images stores in the secondary database (134) t, to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, attempts of hacking, tampering.

[0046]	For example, as the student starts the examination, the examination module (102) collects the examination data during the examination, such as screenshots, images, and voice recordings. During the examination, the examination module (102) monitors the examination data from the first electronic device (110) and detects the violations within the captured images of the student, such as blurry images, no face, multiple faces, and the like. The examination module (102) detects the violations within the recorded audio of the student during the examination such, as multiple voices, murmuring, whispering, and the like. Further, the examination module (102) compares the submitted answer from the primary database (132) and extracted metadata of the screenshots and images stores in the secondary database (134) to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, attempts of hacking, tampering. In the present embodiment, the examination module (102) detects the violation after the examination and alerts the administrator through the administrator interface module (102b). 

[0047]	The examination module (102) generates and organizes collage and video files daily using data from the students. The examination module (102) retrieves data from the primary database (132), the file storage and the secondary database (134) of each student, combines all the data individually, and makes college and video files of each student.  The examination module (102) enables the administrators to retrieve and analyse evidence such as answers, collages, and video files from the first electronic device (110) stored in the primary database (132) and the secondary database (134). The examination module (102) may retrieve the examination data from the student identification number, exam location, and the credentials of the students. For example, when the student completes the examination, the captured or recorded data during the examination are stored in the primary database (132) and secondary database (134). The administrator may access the examination data through the administrator interface module (102b) of the second electronic device (120). The administrator may retrieve the student's examination data within the server (130) by filtering the name, ID number, exam location, photo of the student, date of the examination, and like. The administrator then analyses the searched data of the student to detect any discrepancies, inconsistencies, attempts of hacking tampering. Upon detecting the violation, the administrator can disqualify the student. 

[0048]	Referring now to figure 2, a method (200) for proctoring examination in accordance with the present invention is illustrated. The method (200) is described in conjunction with the system (100) for proctoring examination described in the above paragraphs.

[0049]	The method (200) starts at step 210.

[0050]	At step 220, the examination module (102) verifies the presence and functionality of a web camera (116), a virtual camera (114), and a microphone (112) in the first electronic device (110) before allowing the student to proceed with examinations. For example, when the student starts the examination process through a student interface module (102a) of the examination module (102). The examination module (102) checks the working of the web camera (116) to see if it is ON or OFF, then checks the virtual camera (114) and then verifies whether the microphone (112) working, whether it is connected to the first electronic device (110) or not. In case the examination module finds any problem with the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and microphone (112), the examination module (102) stops the student from accessing the questions of the examination, student will not be able to the next question until the examination module (102) verifies the working of the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and the microphone (112).

[0051]	 At step 230, the examination module (102) stores the answer data from the first electronic device (110) in a primary database (132) of a server (130). When the student starts the examination after verifying the working of the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and microphone (112), the student submits/selects each answer, and the submitted answers are stored directly in the primary database (132) of the server (130).

[0052]	 At step 240, the examination module (102) captures the data from the first electronic device (110), including real-time screenshots, images embedded with the metadata, and audio recordings, and stores them in a file storage ( not shown). During the examination, when the student submits/selects the answer, the answer data is stored in the primary database (132). Also, the virtual camera (114) captures a screenshot of the submitted/selected answer embedded with the metadata and stores the captured screenshot in the file storage. The web camera (116) captures the images of the student during the examination. The time gap between each image captured by the web camera (116) is 5 seconds.  In another embodiment, the web camera (116) may capture the student and the virtual camera (114) captures the screenshot simultaneously. Further, the microphone (112) records the audio of the student during the examination. The examination data (screenshots, images, audio recordings) received from the student interface module (102a) of the first electronic device (110) are stored in the file storage. 

[0053]	At step 250, the examination module (102) extracts the metadata including the question ID and attempted option ID, from the screenshots stored in the file storage and records the metadata within the secondary database (134). 

[0054]	 At step 260, the examination module (102) evaluates the examination data stored within the primary database (132) and secondary database (134) to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or attempts of hacking or tampering.  The evaluation process involves comparing student responses, and data between the primary database (132) and the metadata stored in the secondary database (134).  Further, the examination module (102) reconciles and compares the submitted answer from the primary database (132) and the extracted metadata stored in the secondary database (134) to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, or attempts of hacking or tampering. In the present embodiment, the examination module (102) detects any violation during the examination and alerts the administrator through the administrator interface module (102b). During the examination, the examination module (102) monitors the examination data of the first electronic device (110) and detects any violations such as blurry images, no face, multiple faces, and the like. The examination module (102) detects any violations within the recorded audio of the student during the examination such, as multiple voices, murmuring, whispering, and the like.

[0055]	The examination module (102) generates and organizes collage and video files using examination data from the first electronic device (110). The examination module (102) retrieves the examination data of the student from the primary database (132) and the secondary database (134) of the server (130) and reconciles the examination data and makes college and video files of the student. The examination module (102) enables the administrators to retrieve and analyse evidence such as examination data, collages, and video files from the first electronic device (110) stored in the primary database (132) and the secondary database (134). 

[0056]	The examination module (102) may retrieve the examination data from the student identification number, exam location, and the credentials of the students. For example, when the student completes the examination, the attempt data and the captured or recorded data during the examination are stored in the primary database (132) and secondary database (134). The administrator may access the examination data through the administrator interface module (102b) of the second electronic device (120). The administrator may retrieve the student's examination data within the server (130) by filtering the name, ID number, exam location, photo of the student, date of the examination, and like. The administrator then analyses the searched data of the student to detect violations. Upon detecting the violation, the administrator can disqualify the student. 

[0057]	The method (200) ends at step 270.

[0058]	The method (200) for proctoring examinations can be understood for example, there are two devices the first electronic device (110) and the second electronic device (120). The first electronic device (110) is integrated with the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and microphone (112). Both the first and second electronic devices (110,120) are configured with the examination module (102). Further, he system (100) is integrated with the server (130) having the primary database (132) and the secondary database (134). Before the student begins the exam, the system (100) checks the functionality of the web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and microphone (112) on the first electronic device (110). This ensures that all necessary equipment is working properly before the student proceeds with answering the questions. If any device is found to be malfunctioning, the student cannot move forward with the exam until all devices are verified as operational.

[0059]	As the student answers each question during the exam, their responses are immediately saved in the primary database (132) on the server (130). This guarantees that all answers are securely recorded in real-time, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the student's submissions.

[0060]	During the exam, the system (100) also captures additional data, including screenshots of the student’s answers, images from the web camera (116) embedded with the metadata, and continuous audio recordings from the microphone (112). The web camera (116) takes pictures of the student every few seconds, while the virtual camera (114) captures screenshots of the student’s answers. The microphone (112) records the student's voice throughout the entire examination. All the data is stored in the file storage, and the metadata extracted from the screenshots and images are stored in the secondary database (134), thereby ensuring to be preserved for monitoring and analysis.

[0061]	The system (100) compares the data from the primary and secondary databases (132,134) to identify and report any discrepancies, inconsistencies, attempts of hacking, tampering. The system (100) checks for issues such as blurry images, multiple faces, or irregular sounds, as well as inconsistencies between the answers and screenshots. If any suspicious activity is identified, the system (100) sends an immediate alert to the administrator for further action.

[0062]	After the exam, the system (100) organizes all the collected data, including answers, images, and videos, into collage and video files for each student. Administrators can then search the collected data using criteria like student ID or exam location, allowing them to review and analyse any potential evidence of cheating or irregularities during the exam.

[0063]	Therefore, the present invention of the system (100) and method (200) for proctoring examination provides advantages in ensuring the integrity and security of online assessments. By utilizing the first electronic device equipped with a web camera (116), virtual camera (114), and microphone (112), the system (100) actively monitors the student’s actions throughout the examination, capturing real-time images, audio, and screenshots. This multi-layered monitoring approach, with data stored in both primary and secondary databases (132,134), allows administrators to verify the student's actions and responses, ensuring that discrepancies and inconsistencies, such as cheating or technical issues, are detected and addressed. The examination module (102) compares each submitted answer with corresponding screenshots and images of student, enabling the identification of violations such as undetected faces, multiple faces, or blank images. Additionally, real-time audio recordings are captured to further analyse suspicious behaviours, providing a comprehensive surveillance solution for online exams.
